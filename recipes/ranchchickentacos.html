<h2>Ranch Chicken Tacos</h2>
<p>These ranch chicken tacos are a great change from regular Mexican-style tacos. A quick, cool summer dinner made with leftover rotisserie chicken. Naturally, you can use any type of chicken cooked the way you like; just be sure to shred it for real tacos.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>½ cup ranch dressing</li>

    <li>¼ cup reduced-fat sour cream</li>

    <li>1 (1 ounce) packet taco seasoning mix, divided</li>

    <li>1 tablespoon mild chunky salsa</li>

    <li>2 cups shredded rotisserie chicken</li>

    <li>8 (6 inch) corn tortillas</li>

    <li>shredded lettuce</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Combine ranch dressing, sour cream, 1 teaspoon taco seasoning, and salsa in a small bowl. Cover and refrigerate until serving.</li>
    <li>Toss chicken with remaining taco seasoning. Cover bowl loosely with wax paper or plastic wrap. Microwave chicken until chicken is heated through, about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Warm tortillas in a skillet for about a minute on each side to make them pliable. Place a scoop of chicken on the tortilla and top with lettuce, tomato, green onion, olives, avocado, cheese, and a spoonful of the ranch dressing mixture.</li>
